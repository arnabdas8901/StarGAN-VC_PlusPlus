StarGAN-VC++: Towards Emotion Preserving Voice Conversion Using Deep Embeddings
==========================================================================================

1. There are 15 folders, having naming convention: <source_emotion>_<folder_id>

2. Each folder has 3 files:
	i) source.wav: the stimuli or the original file, which is used for conversion. The emotion of the source file is depicted by the folder name.
	ii) baseline.wav: the conversion produced by the baseline model.
	iii) stargan++.wav: the conversion produced by our method (StarGAN++).
